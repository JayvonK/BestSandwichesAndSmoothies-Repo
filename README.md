Main landing page is fine but it seems like some of the assets arent connected like the other pages in th enavbar and footer

Food menu page has some formating issues that could fixed with some more time, i know they can do it because the drinks page looks fine, also there is supposed to be a hover effect on the food options at the top of the page like on the main page and in the figma but other than that this page is good and could be fixed with time

Drink page just has the same thing with menu items at the top that are missing the hover effect but other than that this page is great

About us page looks amazing and the vidoe is very nice
